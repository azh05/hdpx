Description: Model categorical count data with hierarchical Dirichlet
    process (HDP) mixture models. If you want to do mutational signature
    discovery, you probably want to use package mSigHdp, which calls
    this package. This package is only supported on Linux systems.
    Includes functions to initialise an HDP model with a custom tree
    structure, perform Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution,
    and analyse the output. The underlying mathematical theory is
    described by Teh et al. (Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes,
    Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2006, 101:476). This
    R package is based on code forked from Nicola Roberts, 
    https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp. Roberts adapted the R code
    from open source MATLAB code and incorporated C code from Yee
    Whye Teh (MATLAB and C code available at
    http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/research/npbayes/npbayes-r21.tgz).
    Subsequent changes by Rozen and Liu are mostly confined to the R code.
    These include (1) corrections to garbage collection in the interface
    to the C code and (2) a new function for computing unsigned 
    Stirling numbers of the first kind (3) a complete re-working of
    the process by which "raw clusters" sampled in posterior chains are 
    combined into "components" (sets of mutations generated by one 
    mutational process) (4) new functions for plotting to visualize 
    and evaluate components extracted by the new procedures. There are also
    revised suggestions for burnin procedures and for setting hyperparameters 
    for the concentration parameters; see https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp.
