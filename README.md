R pkg for Hierarchical Dirichlet Process

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/steverozen/hdpx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/steverozen/hdpx)

To install, first ensure `remotes` package is installed and the BioConductor repositories are available (run `setRepositories()`). 
It might take a few minutes to download any missing dependencies and build the vignettes. 
```R
remotes::install_github(repo = "steverozen/hdpx", ref = "master", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

Model categorical count data with a hierarchical Dirichlet
    Process. Includes functions to initialise a HDP with a custom tree
    structure, perform Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution,
    and analyse the output. The underlying mathematical theory is
    described by Teh et al. (Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes,
    Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2006, 101:476). This
    R package is based on code forked from Nicola Roberts, 
    https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdpwho. Roberts adapted this code
    from open source MATLAB and C code written by Yee Whye Teh and 
    available here
    http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/research/npbayes/npbayes-r21.tgz.
    Subsequent changes by Rozen and Liu are confined to the R code.
    These include (1) a corrections to garbage collection in the interface
    to the C code and (2) rewritten function for computing unsigned 
    Stirling numbers of the first kind (3) a fairly complete re-working of
    the process by which "raw clusters" sampled in posterior chains are 
    combined into "components" (sets of mutations generated by one 
    mutational process) There is also new code for plotting to visualize 
    and evaluate components extracted by the new procedures, plus revised 
    suggestions for burnin procedures and for setting hyperparameters for 
    the concentration parameters; see 
    https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp.
