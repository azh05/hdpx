R pkg for Hierarchical Dirichlet Process

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/steverozen/hdpx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/steverozen/hdpx)

To install, first ensure `remotes` package is installed and the BioConductor repositories are available (run `setRepositories()`). 
It might take a few minutes to download any missing dependencies. 
```R
remotes::install_github(repo = "steverozen/hdpx", ref = "master")
```

Model categorical count data with a hierarchical Dirichlet
    Process. Includes functions to initialize a HDP with a custom tree
    structure, perform Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution,
    and analyse the output. The underlying mathematical theory is
    described by Teh et al. 
    "Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes", Journal of the American Statistical
    Association 2006;101(476):1566-1581
    (https://doi.org/10.1198/016214506000000302).

This R package is based on code forked from Nicola Roberts, 
    https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp. Roberts adapted the R code
    from Teh and colleagues' open source MATLAB code
    and incorporated Teh's C code, as does this package (please see
    details below).
    Robert's thesis is at
    https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/275454/Roberts-2018-PhD.pdf.
    
Subsequent changes by Rozen and Liu are confined to the R code.
    These include
    
1. Corrections to garbage collection in the interface
    to the C code
    
2. A new function for computing unsigned 
    Stirling numbers of the first kind. See functions xmake.s in xmake.s.R
    and function .onLoad in zzz.R.
    
3. A complete re-working of
    the process by which "raw clusters" sampled in posterior chains are 
    combined into "components" (sets of mutations generated by one 
    mutational process)
    
4. New functions for plotting to visualize 
    and evaluate components extracted by the new procedures
    
There are also
    revised suggestions for burnin procedures and for setting hyperparameters 
    for the concentration parameters; see https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp.
